# senta-telegram-bot

This bot is an example of using the [Senta.tv API](https://senta.tv/api-docs).

To start this bot, you need to create your own Telegram bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and edit `config.json`.

1. Create your own bot with `BotFather`.
2. Get the bot token, which looks like `745141000:BBFac11FCL1-1rdcLsDBdJoAnn0sXzDn6iS`, and set it as the `tlg_token` in `config.json`.
3. Get the API token from the Senta streamer's settings and set the `api_token` field (you need to have a Senta-streamer license).
4. Start the bot.

This bot is provided "as is" and is an example of using the Senta-streamer API.
